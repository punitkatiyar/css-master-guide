# CSS 2D Transform Methods

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is primarily a 2D styling language, meaning it deals with the layout and presentation of elements in two dimensions. However, CSS can be used to create effects that simulate a third dimension or give the illusion of depth. For true 3D transformations and animations, additional technologies such as WebGL or CSS 3D transforms are often used.**
